## 📄 License

This project is distributed under the **MIT** license - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.

### Run the Inference API (Rust)
```bash
# From the project root
MODEL_PATH=./malaria-model.bin cargo run --bin server
# The API listens by default on http://localhost:8080
```

Endpoints:
- `GET /health` → returns `ok`
- `POST /predict` (multipart/form-data, field `image`) → returns `{ class, probabilities }`

### Run the Inference UI (Vite + React)
```bash
cd inference-ui
# Optional: create a .env.local file to configure the API URL
echo "VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080" > .env.local

npm install
npm run dev   # opens http://localhost:5173
```

In the UI, go to the "Analyze" page (top menu) to:
- upload a blood smear image (drag & drop or file selection)
- send the request to the `/predict` API
- view the predicted class (Parasitized / Uninfected) and probabilities

CORS Note: the server allows any origin in development. For production, restrict origins on the server as needed.

### Run the Inference UI (Yew + Trunk)
This repository also contains a Rust/Yew-based web UI that mirrors the React app’s functionality.

Requirements:
- Rust target `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Trunk (install with `cargo install trunk`)

Steps:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cd inference-ui

# Optional: override API base similar to Vite's VITE_API_BASE
# You can define a global at runtime before the WASM is loaded in index.html, e.g.:
# <script>window.VITE_API_BASE = "http://localhost:8080";</script>

trunk serve --open
# opens http://127.0.0.1:8080 or similar; it will proxy static files. Ensure the Rust API is running separately.
```

Notes:
- The Yew UI implements the Analyze flow: health badge, file picker/drag & drop preview, POST `/predict`, and probability bars.
- Styling is kept lightweight but matches the current dark theme and layout.
